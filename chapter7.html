    <h1>Chapter 7: The Shadow of Hunters</h1>
    <p>The monsoon soon washed the land clean and withdrew, leaving the forest bright and the earth scented sweetly of sap and rain. As the streams shrank back to their channels and the grass dried, Bhim felt an undercurrent of unease ripple through his friends. Birds flitted restlessly from tree to tree and sometimes went silent in the middle of a song. One morning, following the path of a deer, Bhim found something he had never seen before: a loop of wire hidden in the leaves, its gleam cruel in the dappled light.</p>
    <p>“It’s a snare,” whispered Kanti, the sly fox, who appeared at his side. Before Bhim could ask more, a soft bleat sounded from ahead. They pushed through the undergrowth and discovered a young antelope struggling in another wire, its leg bleeding where the metal had cut. Bhim knelt, murmured soothing words, and worked at the knot until the loop fell away. The antelope bounded off with a grateful glance, leaving Bhim staring at the traps in horror.</p>
    <p>“Who would do this?” Bhim asked, anger and worry mixing like bitter herbs on his tongue.</p>
    <p>“Poachers,” Kanti replied, her eyes hard. “Men who hunt for profit. They have come from the north. Their leader is called Rajan. He hates the forest and everything that lives in it.”</p>
    <p>That evening Bhim listened from the shadows as the elders murmured in low voices. Word had spread that strangers were camped near the far river bend. Some villagers whispered about the money the poachers might offer, others shook their heads in fear. Bhim’s father frowned, his calloused fingers drumming on his knee. “Hunting deer for meat is one thing,” he said. “But nets and traps and guns? They bring trouble we do not need.” The headman agreed to send word to the forest ranger, but help would take days.</p>
    <p>Bhim could not sit and wait. In the morning he crept with Kanti and Lila along the deer paths. They saw footprints larger than any they had ever seen, piles of drying meat wrapped in leaves, and at last, through a screen of bamboo, a clearing with tents and smoke. Men sat sharpening knives. In the centre stood a tall man with a scar across his cheek, speaking to the others in a low, commanding tone.</p>
    <p>“Tomorrow we go deeper,” the man said. “There is talk of elephants with big tusks and perhaps even a white tiger. We take everything we can.”</p>
    <p>“That is Rajan,” Kanti whispered. “His parents were killed by a tiger when he was a boy. He thinks all animals are evil. He will not stop until the forest is silent.”</p>
    <p>Bhim’s stomach clenched. He remembered his dream of the Whisperers and the promise he had made at the stone circle. He could not allow this hatred to spill unchecked into the forest. That night, beneath the banyan, he gathered his friends—Jumbo, Lila, Kanti, the monkeys, the deer. “Poachers have come,” he said. “We must watch and warn. No one goes alone. If you see a trap, call out. If you see these men, hide and run and tell me. The forest has protected us; now we will protect it.” The animals nodded, their eyes reflecting the firelight and their shared resolve. The shadow of hunters had fallen across their home, but they would stand together.</p>
