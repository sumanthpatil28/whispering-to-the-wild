<h1>Chapter 8: The Shadow of Hunters</h1>
<p>The rains had long since retreated, leaving the forest paths dappled with sunlight. Bhim noticed the animals were restless: Lila chirped uneasy notes, the monkeys moved through the trees more cautiously, and Jumbo’s great ears twitched at every sound.</p>
<p>He froze, staring at the cruel loop. Beside him, Kanti’s fur bristled. &quot;A snare,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Humans set it to catch legs and necks.&quot;</p>
<p>Before Bhim could speak, a plaintive bleat sounded deeper in the brush. Together they pushed through and found a young antelope struggling on the ground, its hind leg caught in another wire. Blood stained the leaves. Bhim’s throat tightened. &quot;Hold still,&quot; he murmured, kneeling beside the trembling creature. His small fingers worked at the knot, and with a sharp twist the wire loosened. The antelope limped away, thanking him with a nod of its head before disappearing into the trees.</p>
<p>&quot;Who would do this?&quot; Bhim asked, anger and sadness swirling inside him.</p>
<p>Kanti’s eyes were hard. &quot;Men who take lives for money. Poachers. They have come from the north. Their leader is called Rajan.&quot;</p>
<p>That evening Bhim sat with his parents by the fire and listened to the elders whisper about strangers camping near the river, men with nets and guns. His father frowned. &quot;They are not like the company loggers,&quot; he said. &quot;These men hunt what should not be hunted. The headman sent word to the ranger, but help is slow.&quot;</p>
<p>Bhim could not sleep. In the dark, Lila perched on his window ledge. &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; she whispered, &quot;we will find out more.&quot;</p>
<p>At dawn Bhim crept with his friends through the forest. They saw fresh boot prints, piles of meat salted and wrapped, and at last, through a veil of bamboo, they saw the poachers’ camp. Men sat around a smoky fire sharpening knives. Two cages held frightened monkeys. Near the fire stood a tall man with a scar across his cheek. He spoke in a low, commanding voice.</p>
<p>&quot;We move deeper tomorrow,&quot; he said. &quot;There is talk of a white tiger and elephants with tusks like curved swords. We take them all.&quot;</p>
<p>Kanti hissed softly. &quot;That is Rajan,&quot; she said. &quot;He hates the forest. He says animals are devils.&quot;</p>
<p>Bhim’s heart hammered. He wanted to burst from the bushes and shout, but Lila tugged at his hair. &quot;Not yet,&quot; she whispered. &quot;We must think.&quot;</p>
<p>They slipped away to the safety of the great banyan, where they called a meeting. Monkeys, deer, boars, birds, and even Kavi the old turtle gathered around Bhim as he spoke. &quot;There are men with traps and guns,&quot; he said. &quot;We must watch and warn each other. No one goes alone. If they come for you, cry out and we will help.&quot; The animals nodded. The forest, which had always felt like a playground, now felt like a battlefield. Bhim knew the Whisperers’ gift had called him for a reason. The fight was about to begin.</p>
