    <h1>Chapter 6: The Forest’s Voice</h1>
    <p>True to their word, the loggers moved their axes downstream for a few days.  Letters with seals arrived from the distant company, and whispers spread through the village.  Some people grumbled that Bhim had complicated a simple matter.  Others brought him extra mangoes as thanks.  Bhim knew the reprieve would not last.  He could feel the forest’s worry like a taut string.</p>
    <p>One evening Jumbo and his father came to the village edge.  The great bull’s ears fanned as he spoke softly.  “The company returns with machines.  We will stand with you, but words alone may not stop them.”</p>
    <p>Bhim followed them deep into the forest, beyond any place he had been.  In a grove encircled by upright stones covered in moss, the air hummed.  “This is where Whisperers are welcomed,” Jumbo’s father explained.  “Here Mowgli stood when the forest chose him.”</p>
    <p>Bhim knelt.  As he placed his hands on the damp earth inside the circle, a low thrumming filled his bones.  Voices layered upon voices murmured, not in words but in feelings — gratitude, caution, hope.  Images flickered behind his eyes: a boy running with wolves; a woman singing to deer; storms and wildfires and hands planting saplings.  Tears sprang to his eyes.  He felt both terribly small and woven into something vast.</p>
    <p>“Do you accept?” the whispers seemed to ask.</p>
    <p>“Yes,” Bhim whispered back.  “I will listen and speak when needed.”</p>
    <p>Warmth flooded his chest and then faded, leaving a steady, quiet strength.  When he opened his eyes, the humming had ebbed, but the sense of being accompanied remained.  Jumbo’s father touched him lightly with his trunk.  “You carry us with you now,” he said.</p>
    <p>The next day the roar of engines shattered the morning calm.  A huge, iron‑jawed machine rolled toward the grove, its blades gleaming.  The loggers marched behind it.  Bhim stepped into its path.  At his sides stood Jumbo, Ram, deer, boar, monkeys, and even shy creatures like porcupines and peacocks.  Birds wheeled overhead, their shadows dappling the ground.</p>
    <p>“Move aside,” the foreman shouted over the din.  “We have work to do.”</p>
    <p>Bhim raised his head.  The fear he had felt melted away in the face of the drumbeat he carried within him.  “This grove holds the spring and the temple,” he said, his voice stronger than he expected.  “If you cut it, floods and droughts will follow.  Go to the grasslands beyond the big rock.  Cut there, and for each tree you take, plant two.  The forest will bless you for it.”</p>
    <p>The foreman laughed and waved his hand.  The machine lurched forward.  Ram lifted his trunk and let loose a trumpet blast that shook leaves from branches.  Birds dived at the machine, pecking and flapping.  Monkeys screeched and leaped, shaking vines.  The driver yelped and covered his face.  The villagers, drawn by the commotion, arrived at the clearing.  Seeing the stand between boy and beast, something shifted in their faces.</p>
    <p>The headman pushed through the crowd and raised his arms.  “Stop!” he cried.  “We will not cut here.”  He turned to the foreman, voice steady.  “Take your machines to the grasslands.  We will send men to help you there, and we will plant saplings to replace what is felled.  If you refuse, you will work without us.”</p>
    <p>The foreman scowled, but he looked at the headman, at the line of animals, and at Bhim standing like a sapling in the wind.  Slowly he nodded.  “Fine,” he said.  “Show us.”</p>
    <p>As the machines rumbled away, Bhim felt a weight lift.  His father came and placed a hand on his shoulder.  “I did not understand before,” he murmured.  “I thought you were playing with birds and leaves.  But you have reminded us that we belong to this place.  Thank you.”</p>
    <p>That night Bhim returned to the circle of stones.  He sat in the quiet and listened.  A breeze rustled the leaves, and in it he heard many soft voices, not words but the feeling of approval, of belonging, of unity.  “We are one,” they seemed to say.  Bhim smiled and closed his eyes.  His story — and the forest’s — would continue, but for now there was peace.</p>
