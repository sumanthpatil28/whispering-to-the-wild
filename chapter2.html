    <h1>Chapter 2: The Forest</h1>
    <p>The first time Bhim ventured deep into the forest, it was with his parents.  The villagers were carrying garlands and clay bowls of rice and flowers to the small stone temple hidden beneath an ancient sal tree.  Bhim walked between his mother and father, clutching a packet of marigold petals.  Tall trunks rose around them like pillars, their leaves filtering the sunlight into green ribbons.  Birds flitted overhead and unseen creatures scurried in the undergrowth.</p>
    <p>As they crossed a stream on a fallen log, Bhim heard giggling.  A small grey monkey with quick hands and an impish face was crouching on the branch above him.  “Don’t slip,” the monkey chattered.  “The water is cold this morning.”</p>
    <p>Bhim grinned.  “I’ll be careful,” he whispered.  He reached the other side without dropping a petal.  The monkey swung beside him as he walked.  “Where are you going?” the monkey asked.</p>
    <p>“To the temple,” Bhim replied.  “We bring offerings at the end of harvest.”</p>
    <p>“Ah,” said the monkey.  “Then you’ll like who you meet.”  He scampered up a vine and disappeared.</p>
    <p>Near the temple, Bhim heard a whimper.  Moving away from the path, he found a small grey rabbit with long ears caught in a tangle of thorny vines.  Its fur was ruffled and its eyes were wide with fear.  “Help me,” the rabbit squeaked.  “These thorns are mean.”</p>
    <p>Bhim knelt and gently pulled the vines aside, careful not to scratch himself.  Once freed, the rabbit shook itself and thumped its hind foot in thanks.  “You have quick fingers,” it said, whiskers twitching.  “Are you the boy who hears?”</p>
    <p>Before Bhim could answer, a deep groan rumbled through the trees.  It was a sound of pain.  He looked at the rabbit, who nodded toward a shadowy grove.  “He needs help more than I did.”</p>
    <p>Bhim followed the sound until he came upon a young elephant calf lying by a fallen branch.  Its ear was torn and bleeding.  Tears streaked its dusty cheeks.  “It hurts,” the calf moaned.  “I tripped and the branch cut me.”</p>
    <p>“I’m Bhim,” he said gently, stepping closer.  “Let me look.”  He tore a strip of cloth from the edge of his own shawl and soaked it in cool stream water.  With careful hands he cleaned the wound, then chewed a few leaves of a plant his mother had taught him about and pressed the poultice to the cut.  The calf flinched but did not pull away.</p>
    <p>“Thank you,” it whispered when he tied the cloth in place.  “My name is Jumbo.”</p>
    <p>Bhim smiled.  “Rest, Jumbo.  The pain will ease.”  He looked up and saw a huge shadow moving between the trees — a larger elephant watching, eyes filled with concern.  “He is safe,” Bhim called softly.</p>
    <p>That day, as his parents prayed at the temple, Bhim found a new kind of prayer among the roots and leaves.  The forest felt alive around him, aware of his footsteps.  When he placed his marigold petals before the stone shrine, he whispered not only to the deity but also to the creatures who had become his friends.  A warm breeze rustled the sal leaves as if in reply.  On the walk home, Jumbo’s mother raised her trunk in silent salute.  Bhim realized his life had grown bigger than the fields and lanes of his village.  There were voices waiting for him beyond the first line of trees.</p>
