    <h1>Chapter 7: Peaceful Days</h1>
    <p>In the weeks after the loggers left the grove, the forest breathed easier. The air seemed clearer, the river ran brighter, and the wind carried songs rather than worry. Bhim and his friends spent their days helping the villagers plant saplings in the grasslands beyond the big rock. They laughed as they worked, and every hole in the earth felt like a promise.</p>
    <p>Bhim grew a little taller and a little wiser. He still listened each night to the whispers in the leaves, but now they were mostly contented sighs. Jumbo taught him how to sense rain in the smell of soil, and Lila taught him a hundred names for the color green. Ram told stories of past Whisperers, and Kavi showed him how moss always grows on the northern side of stone.</p>
    <p>As the seasons turned, Bhim felt his life weaving deeper into the forest. He visited the circle of stones often, sitting in silence until the hum in his bones matched the hum of the earth. Sometimes he dreamed of the old guardians again—faces half-hidden in mist—who watched him with kind eyes and whispered that he was on the right path.</p>
    <p>But peace in the forest is like sunlight through branches—it moves and changes. One afternoon, Bhim noticed a patch of crushed grass near a stream, as if heavy boots had passed that way. Lila returned from a far flight and spoke of strange voices on the wind. Kanti sniffed the air and smelled iron and smoke where there should have been flowers.</p>
    <p>Bhim’s heart tightened. He remembered the warning in the turtle’s old eyes: danger would come again. He looked toward the deeper forest and knew their rest was ending. “We must be ready,” he said to his friends. In the distance, unseen, a steel snare gleamed among the ferns.</p>
