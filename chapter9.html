   <h1>Chapter 10: The Stand for the Forest</h1>
    <p>The poachers' frustration turned to fury. Rajan ordered his men to set more traps and dig pits. They hammered spikes and tied ropes, not caring if the forest bled. Word spread quickly. Birds carried warnings, and the deer changed their grazing grounds. But even with all precautions, danger was everywhere.</p>
    <p>Early one morning, Bhim awoke to Lila's urgent call. &quot;They are moving towards the sacred grove!&quot; she cried. &quot;Rajan has found the path to the white tiger's lair.&quot;</p>
    <p>Bhim's heart lurched. The white tiger was a legend, a creature said to guard the deepest part of the forest. No one saw it, but its presence was felt like a cool breeze on a hot day. &quot;We cannot let them find her,&quot; he said.</p>
    <p>He ran to the grove with Jumbo, Kanti, a troop of monkeys and a swirl of birds. Along the way, they alerted every creature they could. When they reached the grove, they saw Rajan and his men pushing through ferns, machetes flashing. Bhim stepped into their path, his small body a barrier between them and the ancient stones.</p>
    <p>&quot;Move, boy,&quot; Rajan snarled, lifting his gun. &quot;This is no place for children.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;This is no place for guns,&quot; Bhim replied, his voice steady. &quot;You have taken and hurt enough. Leave.&quot;</p>
    <p>Rajan's lip curled. &quot;You think you can stop me? These beasts killed my parents. I will not rest until the forest is cleared of them.&quot;</p>
    <p>As if in answer, the forest itself stirred. Bees rose in a humming cloud and swarmed at the poachers' heads. Monkeys leapt down, yanking hats and bags and tossing them into a muddy pool. Deer burst from the undergrowth, scattering the men's supplies. Birds swooped to peck at boots and ears. Jumbo and the elephants trumpeted, stomping the ground so hard that Rajan's men stumbled and fell.</p>
    <p>Chaos erupted. Men swung their arms, blinded by bees and leaves. They slipped and slid in the mud. Rajan staggered backwards, his foot catching on a root. His gun flew from his hand and landed in a tangle of vines. In the confusion, one of the men shouted, &quot;Watch out!&quot; but it was too late. The ground beneath Rajan gave way, and he plunged into a pit his own men had dug — a trap meant for a tiger.</p>
    <p>Bhim gasped and ran to the edge. Rajan lay at the bottom, stunned, his ankle twisted. Above him, the poachers scrambled to help, but bees drove them back. Rajan looked up, eyes wild. For the first time Bhim saw not anger but fear.</p>
    <p>&quot;Help me!&quot; Rajan shouted.</p>
    <p>Bhim did not hesitate. He grabbed a vine and lowered it into the pit. &quot;Take it,&quot; he said. Rajan stared at him as if he were a ghost.</p>
    <p>&quot;Why are you helping me?&quot; he asked, voice shaking. &quot;I came to kill your friends.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Because you are hurt,&quot; Bhim replied. &quot;And because not all creatures are cruel. There is kindness in the forest too.&quot;</p>
    <p>Slowly, Rajan grasped the vine. With Jumbo's strength, they pulled him out. When he stood on solid ground, sweating and pale, Bhim could see the confusion in his eyes. He expected vengeance and had received mercy.</p>
    <p>Behind Bhim, in the shadows of the grove, two amber eyes watched. The white tiger had arrived, silent as a dream. She stepped forward, muscles rippling beneath her pale fur. Rajan froze, breath hitching. The tiger's gaze flicked from the boy to the man. Instead of leaping, she lowered her head slightly, a gesture both regal and gentle, and vanished into the trees.</p>
    <p>Rajan's mouth opened and closed. His hands shook. He sank to his knees.</p>
