    <h1>Chapter 1: The Beginning</h1>
    <p>Bhim lived at the edge of a small village where the fields met the forest.  He loved to sit on the low stone wall that separated his family’s hut from the dirt road and listen to the birds chatter among themselves.  Their songs were like stories, though for most people they were only sound.  One afternoon, while he was watching a pair of sparrows hop in the dust, he heard a soft whisper that was different from any human voice.</p>
    <p>“You’re staring awfully hard,” said the whisper.  Bhim jumped, looking around for the speaker.  A little brown bird with a shimmering throat perched on the wall just a few handspans from his elbow.  She blinked at him with bright black eyes.  “Can you hear me?” she asked.</p>
    <p>Bhim’s mouth fell open.  “I… I can hear you!” he gasped.  His heart pounded as if he had been running.  “Are you talking?”</p>
    <p>The bird fluffed her feathers.  “Of course I am talking.  My name is Lila.  I’ve been watching you for days.  You listen better than the other children.  Usually, only the squirrels listen to me, and they are terrible gossips.”</p>
    <p>For a long moment Bhim could only stare.  He had always felt there were meanings in the rustle of leaves and chirps of birds, but he had never expected them to arrange themselves into sentences.  “Why can I understand you?” he whispered at last.</p>
    <p>Lila cocked her head.  “Maybe you have a gift.  We have legends of humans who could listen.  Maybe you are one of them.”</p>
    <p>That evening, Bhim told his mother, speaking in a low voice so his father would not hear.  She was kneading dough by the firelight, her bangles chiming softly with each movement.  He told her about Lila and the words of the bird.  His mother’s hands stilled.  She did not laugh or scold him.  Instead she reached out and touched his cheek.</p>
    <p>“My father used to tell me stories of those who could whisper to the wild,” she said softly.  “They could hear the thoughts of animals and trees.  They were guardians.  He said the last one lived far away, long before you were born.  I never thought I would meet another.”</p>
    <p>“Do you think I’m like them?” Bhim asked, both excited and afraid.</p>
    <p>She smiled and pulled him close.  “Maybe.  The forest is part of our lives, Bhim.  It feeds us and shelters us.  To hear it is a blessing, but others may not understand.  Keep this quiet for now.  Listen carefully and be kind.  The forest speaks in whispers.”</p>
    <p>That night, Bhim lay awake on his mat, staring at the thatch above him.  Outside, crickets sang and a breeze rustled the banana leaves.  Every sound felt different now, weighted with possible meaning.  He thought of Lila’s bright eyes and his mother’s gentle story.  Beyond the village, the forest waited.  Bhim closed his eyes and dreamed of trees whose leaves murmured secrets and of a path leading deeper than he had ever gone.</p>
