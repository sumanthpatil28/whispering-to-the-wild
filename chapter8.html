    <hChapter 9: Rajan’s Past
    <p>In the days that followed, the poachers' presence seeped deeper into the forest like smoke. Bhim and his friends worked tirelessly: monkeys swung through the canopy to spy on the hunters; Kanti carried messages on swift paws; Lila watched from above. They freed trapped birds and gnawed at ropes that held cages shut, scattering their marks and leaving false trails to confuse the men.</p>
    <p>One afternoon, hiding behind an outcrop of rock near the poachers' camp, Bhim overheard a conversation that gave him pause. Rajan, the leader, sat sharpening his machete. His hands were steady, but his face was shadowed.</p>
    <p>&quot;Why are we wasting time with squirrels and parrots?&quot; grumbled one of his men. &quot;There are easier ways to make money.&quot;</p>
    <p>Rajan's eyes flashed. &quot;You don't know what animals are,&quot; he spat. &quot;They took everything from me. My father and mother were good people. One night, when I was a boy, a tiger leapt from the darkness and killed them while they were walking home. I hid in the grass and watched its eyes shine like fire as it dragged them away. Since then, I have sworn to hunt every creature with claws and fangs.&quot;</p>
    <p>Bhim felt his breath catch. He could see the pain behind the harsh words, the hollowed-out place where love had been. Lila pressed her wing to his cheek. &quot;He is hurt,&quot; she whispered. &quot;He thinks hate will heal him.&quot;</p>
    <p>That night, around the banyan, Bhim told the animals what he had learned. &quot;Rajan believes all animals are bad because a tiger killed his parents,&quot; he said. Kavi's ancient eyes closed for a moment, as if remembering.</p>
    <p>&quot;A sad mistake,&quot; the turtle murmured. &quot;Tigers hunt to eat. They don't know human laws. But pain makes eyes see only darkness. We must show him light.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;How?&quot; asked the rabbit, ears drooping. &quot;He will not listen to us.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;He may listen to me,&quot; Bhim said quietly. &quot;Or at least, he may listen when I save him as he once lost.&quot;</p>
    <p>Their plan formed like a weave of vines. Bhim and the animals would continue to protect each other and sabotage the poachers' efforts. They would not harm the men, but they would be relentless. And when the moment came, Bhim would find a way to speak to Rajan heart to heart.</p>
    <p>Days stretched into nights. The poachers grew frustrated as traps sprang empty and trails vanished. They chased shadows created by monkeys throwing nuts and birds calling in false alarms. Rajan cursed and drove his men onward. On the seventh day, they captured a young elephant calf that had wandered from Jumbo's herd.</p>
    <p>Jumbo trumpeted in despair. &quot;They have my niece!&quot; he cried. His eyes blazed and his huge legs stomped the earth.</p>
    <p>&quot;We will get her back,&quot; Bhim promised. Under the cover of darkness, he and a band of animals crept to the cage where the calf whimpered. Bhim whispered soothing words and slipped a stick between the bars to lift the latch. The calf squeezed out and followed them silently into the forest. In the morning, when Rajan's men discovered the empty cage and the trampled path leading nowhere, they shouted and argued. Rajan's jaw clenched.</p>
    <p>&quot;This forest plays tricks,&quot; he said. &quot;But tricks will not stop me.&quot;</p>
    <p>Bhim knew then that talk alone would not change Rajan. It would take something more — a moment where the hunter needed saving, where kindness from the forest could crack his shell of anger.</p>
