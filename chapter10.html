   <h1>Chapter 11: Rajan’s Awakening</h1>
    <p>The forest was quiet, as if holding its breath. Bhim knelt beside Rajan and spoke softly. &quot;Do you see?&quot; he asked. &quot;The tiger did not kill you. She knows you are hurt and scared. Animals feel fear and love, just like we do. Some act in anger, some in defense, but many are peaceful.&quot;</p>
    <p>Rajan stared at the ground. For a long moment, only the sound of birdsong and the whisper of leaves filled the air. At last he looked up, his eyes no longer hard. &quot;When I was a boy,&quot; he said, his voice rough, &quot;my parents were walking late. A tiger came from nowhere. I ran, and they were gone. I thought all animals were monsters. I hated them so I would not feel hurt. But today... you pulled me from a trap. A tiger spared me. How can this be?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Pain makes us forget,&quot; Bhim said. &quot;We think all shadows hide teeth. But the forest gave you life too — water, fruit, wood for your fire. Animals feed their young. Birds sing to each other. There are bad people and good people, bad animals and good animals. We cannot judge all by one.&quot; He pointed to Jumbo, who stood nearby. &quot;This elephant saved my life once. He is my friend. Will you call him a monster?&quot;</p>
    <p>Jumbo lifted his trunk and gently touched Rajan's shoulder. Rajan flinched, then slowly reached up and laid his hand on the rough, warm skin. Tears filled his eyes.</p>
    <p>&quot;I... I am tired,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Tired of hate. Tired of killing.&quot; He stood shakily and turned to his men, who watched from a distance, unsure. &quot;We are leaving,&quot; he said. &quot;There will be no more hunting here.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;What?&quot; cried one of the men. &quot;But the money—&quot;</p>
    <p>Rajan shook his head. &quot;What is money worth if your heart is a stone? I came to this forest to take revenge. Instead, I found something I lost long ago. Go. Drop your weapons. We will find honest work.&quot;</p>
    <p>Slowly, one by one, the poachers lowered their guns and knives. Some muttered, some sighed with relief. Together they turned and walked back the way they had come, the hum of the forest growing louder as their footsteps faded.</p>
    <p>Bhim watched them go with a mixture of exhaustion and hope. Lila landed on his shoulder. &quot;You did it,&quot; she whispered. &quot;You changed a heart.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;I didn’t do it alone,&quot; Bhim replied, looking around at his friends — at Jumbo and Kanti, at the monkeys and birds, at Kavi and the deer. &quot;The forest did. We all did.&quot;</p>
    <p>As the sun dipped low and painted the treetops gold, the animals gathered in celebration. They sang and trumpeted, chattered and chirped. Even the white tiger watched from afar, her eyes soft. Bhim's parents came and held him tightly, proud and awed by their son's bravery and compassion.</p>
    <p>That night, as Bhim lay on his mat under the thatch, the whispers of the forest were no longer fearful. They were lullabies. Season&nbsp;1 of his journey — the first ten chapters of his life as a Whisperer — had ended, not with a fight but with understanding. Bhim closed his eyes and smiled, dreaming of a future where humans and animals listened to one another and walked together beneath the stars.</p>
