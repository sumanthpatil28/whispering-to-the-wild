    <h1>Chapter 3: Who is Mowgli?</h1>
    <p>The months that followed were filled with small miracles.  Bhim returned to the forest often, sometimes with his parents and sometimes alone, always with Lila on his shoulder or a monkey swinging along nearby.  He learned the different calls of the langur monkeys and the warning hiss of cobras.  He learned which berries were sweet and which leaves soothed a sore throat.  Jumbo grew quickly, and every time Bhim saw him the calf’s ears flapped in happiness.</p>
    <p>One afternoon, as Bhim sat with Jumbo by a waterhole, a much larger elephant approached.  His skin was wrinkled and scarred, and his tusks were long and worn.  Jumbo trumpeted softly.  “This is my father,” he said.  “He is very wise.”</p>
    <p>“So you are the boy who healed my son,” the big elephant rumbled.  His voice was like distant thunder.  “Thank you, little one.”  He lowered his massive head in a gesture of respect that made Bhim blush.
    </p>
    <p>They talked for a while — about the river’s path, about the taste of different grasses, about the best mud for bathing.  Then the old elephant’s eyes grew distant.  “Long ago, before you were born,” he said, “there was another human who spoke as you do.  His name was Mowgli.”</p>
    <p>Bhim sat up straighter.  “Mowgli?”  The name felt like a breeze whispering through leaves.  “Who was he?”</p>
    <p>“He was a child found by wolves,” the elephant replied.  “He could speak to the forest and to men.  He lived between our worlds.  When hunters came, he convinced them to leave certain groves untouched.  When the river flooded, he led the animals to high ground.  He was brave and kind.  When he grew older, he went away.  Some say he became a legend.  Others say he never truly left.”</p>
    <p>Bhim’s mind spun with questions.  He had never thought about anyone else having his gift.  “Where did he go?  Is he still alive?” he asked.
    </p>
    <p>“No one knows,” Jumbo’s father said, shaking his large head slowly.  “He went beyond the mountains.  We tell his story to remind ourselves that humans can be part of the forest, not apart from it.  You have his courage in your eyes.”</p>
    <p>That evening Bhim sat with his mother under their mango tree and told her what he had heard.  She listened quietly, then whispered, “My grandmother used to tell stories of a boy raised by wolves.  I thought they were just tales to make children sit still.  Perhaps they were real.  There is so much I do not know.”  She looked at Bhim’s hands, still stained green from gathering leaves.  “Perhaps you will find out.”</p>
    <p>From that day on, Bhim could not stop thinking about Mowgli.  When he walked through the fields, he imagined a boy running with wolves under the full moon.  When he fetched water from the well, he pictured a young man convincing hunters to lower their bows.  The forest seemed deeper now, layered with stories and secrets.  Bhim’s gift felt less like an accident and more like part of a long thread woven through time.  He wondered whether the carvings on the temple stones held clues and whether the voices of the trees could tell him more.  He knew one thing for certain: he was not alone.</p>
