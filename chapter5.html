    <h1>Chapter 5: The Lost Path</h1>
    <p>Only a few days after he touched the glowing carvings, Lila woke Bhim before sunrise with frantic flutters of her wings.  “Men,” she whispered.  “Strange men by the river.  They carry axes and smell of oil.”</p>
    <p>Bhim’s stomach clenched.  He slipped out of his house and ran toward the forest, the morning light barely thinning the darkness.  At the edge of the trees he crouched behind a stand of bamboo and peered through the stalks.  A group of men in heavy boots stood around freshly cut stumps, swinging axes into the trunks of young trees.  Piles of logs lay stacked on a cart.  Bhim could almost feel the trees’ pain in his own arms.</p>
    <p>He took a step forward, but a small red fox slid out of the undergrowth and blocked his path.  “Wait,” she said, her voice sharp and clever.  “Running at them now will do nothing.  I am Kanti.  I listen to all news.  These men have permission from your headman to cut.  They do not know the forest’s ways.  We need a plan.”</p>
    <p>Bhim’s jaw tightened.  “I cannot let them cut everything,” he whispered.  “The turtle said the forest is calling for help.”</p>
    <p>“Then we will call humans,” Kanti replied.  “There is a meeting in your village tonight.  Speak there.  Tell them what you know.”</p>
    <p>That evening Bhim stood before a circle of elders and farmers.  His knees trembled but his voice did not falter.  He told them about the men with axes and about the spring under the banyan tree that would dry if the hills were stripped bare.  He spoke of balance and of his friends in the forest.  Some of the elders frowned; others smiled gently.  The headman finally crossed his arms and said, “Show us.”</p>
    <p>At dawn Bhim led the headman and several villagers along a deer path to the great banyan with its curtain of roots.  He brushed leaves aside to reveal a trickle of clear water seeping from the base.  “This water feeds our fields,” he said.  “These roots hold the soil.  If the trees on the slope are cut, the rains will wash everything away.”  The headman knelt, dipped his hands in the spring and drank.  He looked up at the vast canopy overhead.  Bhim saw a flicker of understanding in his eyes, but also hesitation.</p>
    <p>“We need timber,” the headman said slowly.  “If we refuse, the company will bring workers from elsewhere and we will gain nothing.”</p>
    <p>Bhim thought of the glowing spirals and the warm stone under his hand.  He looked at Lila perched on a branch above them and at Kanti’s watchful eyes.  He felt the forest’s drumbeat in his chest.  “Let me try to speak to them,” he said.</p>
    <p>He returned to the clearing alone that afternoon.  The men looked up from their work as he approached.  “Please,” he said, his voice steady.  “The forest asks that you cut farther downstream where the soil is rich and the trees grow quickly.  Leave this grove.  There is a temple and a spring.  Many creatures live here.”</p>
    <p>The men laughed.  One wiped his brow and said, “We have orders.  We go where we are told, not where a child tells us.”</p>
    <p>Bhim took a deep breath.  He placed his fingers to his lips and gave a high, trilling whistle that Lila had taught him.  At first there was only the buzz of insects.  Then branches shook as monkeys swung down, forming a line behind him.  Deer stepped from the shadows, their ears flicking nervously but their eyes steady.  The rabbit sat by Bhim’s foot.  Finally Jumbo’s massive shape appeared, his trunk touching Bhim’s shoulder.  A chorus of quiet voices filled the clearing: “Please.”</p>
    <p>The men stared, their hands lowering.  The one who had laughed scratched his head.  The youngest of them took a step back, eyes wide.  After a long pause the foreman spoke.  “We did not know,” he muttered.  “We will talk to your headman again.”</p>
    <p>It was not a complete victory, but it was a shift.  When Bhim returned to the village, the headman met his gaze differently.  “You have shown us something we forgot,” he said quietly.  “We will speak to the company.  Perhaps there is another path.”</p>
