    <h1>Chapter 4: The Hidden Whisper</h1>
    <p>The rains came and went.  Rice seedlings grew tall and golden, and then the fields lay bare again.  Bhim was taller now, too, his hair longer and his step surer, but the pull of the forest never lessened.  In the quiet moments of dusk, when smoke curled from the cooking fires and the sky turned the colour of ripe guava, he sometimes heard his name carried on the breeze.</p>
    <p>One night he dreamt he was back at the forest temple.  Moonlight fell through the high branches, and on the worn stone floor patterns glowed — spirals and lines that seemed to move like water.  As he reached out to touch them, a deep voice whispered his name.  He woke with his heart thumping, Lila peering at him from her perch.</p>
    <p>“I heard it too,” she said.  “The animals are restless.  Something is stirring.  We should go.”</p>
    <p>At dawn they slipped away.  The morning mist hugged the ground and dew beaded on every leaf.  A cheeky monkey — the same one who had warned him about the stream long ago — dropped from a branch and joined them.  “There is talk of strange lights at the temple,” he chattered.  “I want to see.”</p>
    <p>When they reached the clearing, the temple looked unchanged, its stones blanketed in moss and fig roots.  Then the first ray of sun crept over the canopy and caught the carvings Bhim had seen in his dream.  Spirals and curls appeared on the stone, faint yet shimmering as if written in dew.  Bhim knelt and traced them with a trembling finger.</p>
    <p>“Those are old marks,” said a voice that sounded older still.  Bhim looked up to see an enormous turtle at the water’s edge.  His shell was mottled and his head slow to turn, but his eyes were bright.  “I am Kavi.  These carvings were made by humans and animals together.  They are messages for those who can hear.”</p>
    <p>Bhim bowed his head.  “What do they say?”</p>
    <p>“They say the forest is calling,” Kavi replied.  “Long ago there were humans like you called Whisperers.  They could hear the thoughts of creatures and the sighs of trees.  They helped keep balance.  One of them was named Mowgli.  When trouble threatens, the stones glow and the forest whispers to those who will listen.”</p>
    <p>The turtle’s words sent a shiver through Bhim.  He pressed his palm to the stone.  Warmth spread up his arm and into his chest, and though he could not make out specific words, he felt reassurance and urgency mingled together — like being urged forward by a friendly hand.</p>
    <p>“You are part of this story now,” Kavi said.  “Do not be afraid.  Listen.  The forest will guide you.”</p>
    <p>On the walk home, the whispers were louder.  They were not frightening; they felt like friends murmuring secrets close to his ear.  Bhim’s world had widened again.  The pattern on the stones had told him that his gift was not an accident but a thread woven through time.  Though he did not know what would come next, he knew he would not face it alone.</p>
